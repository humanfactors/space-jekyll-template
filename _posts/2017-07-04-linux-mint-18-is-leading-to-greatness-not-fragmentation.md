title: "Linux Mint 18 is Leading to Greatness not Fragmentation"
date: Tue June 6 2016

In case you hadn't heard, Linux mint just got a big update. Somewhat
controversially, [Mint forked several Gnome,MATE and Xfce applications](http://lwn.net/Articles/689067/) arguably
contributing towards more fragmentation of the GNU/Linux system. This action has
prompted several harsh responses across the internet, including
from, [Linux Unplugged](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/4ivfan/flavorless_mint_lup_144/).
Is it really so bad?

### My Thoughts

I've used various editions of Linux Mint (16, 17, LMDE) over the years, but
currently am a Debian Stretch user. One of my hobbies on the side is salvaging
old computers, and turning them into usable systems for disadvantaged people in
our community. Every single one of these machines I build runs Mint, and that is
only reinforced by these recent updates. I choose Mint for three key reasons for
new users: usability, stability and gloss.

Linux Mint is a very usable system, and the 18.X update further extends this.
I'm not alone in this
belief,  [Sébastien Wilmet from Gnome Blogs makes a similar case](https://blogs.gnome.org/swilmet/2016/06/18/thoughts-on-the-linux-mint-x-apps-forks/).
Mint provides users with a coherent and straightforward system to users, right
out of the box. It requires minimal "tinkering" to get it working, and by in
large (I hate saying this), *it just works.*

So [many of the current Gnome applications have major usability issues](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/usability-gnome),
and it's not articles or my usability testing experience which confirms this to
me -- it's the everyday experience of myself and my clients. Most calls I get
about problems with their new machines is nothing to do with the OS, but with
third-party applications embedded in the system.

The X-application suite will help rectify this issue by providing an intuitively
named suite of applications which have been optimised for the Mint user base.
Moreover, by taking full control over the development of these applications, the
Mint developers can more reliably predict where issues might arise, and are able
to fix these issues without depending on external developers to put it on their
priority list.

This control will also help ensure that *arguably*non-critical bugs and
potential software exploits do not require ongoing patching. This was one of the
key reasons why I don't opt for Ubuntu installations: I want my clients (and
myself) to have minimal updating, and when they must update, have minimal
problems doing so. Again, the more Mint develops these X-Applications, the more
we can expect this stability to continue.

<!-- Mint 18 -- The Gloss Factor -->

Finally, let's get to the "Gloss Factor". Mint looks great out of the box. I
feel happy when I deliver a Windows level of visual appeal with my systems. It
helps users better understand how to use the computer, and it makes them want to
use their computer. In
Mint, [form meets function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function).
A visually appealing Linux is what will help to retain users long into the
future.

### Fragmentation

One of the biggest concerns with the use of X-Applications I am yet to touch on
is Fragmentation. That is, the idea that more and more forks of applications
will lead to many poor versions of software, rather than efforts placed into a
centralized whole. Whilst I think by in large this is a problem for the GNU
community, I don't believe X-Applications to be an instance of this problem. The
new file manager is absolutely gorgeous and matches the Mint theme well overall.
The video below shows some of the new Mint features, and I think the improved
X-Applications fit so nicely in with the overall Mint Philosophy of pragmatism.

One response on Reddit regarding this issue stood out to me. I couldn't have worded it any better myself:

> Redundant applications are the result of software freedom. Software freedom is
> the basis of our platform. You can't tell people what to do with their time;
> that is their freedom to exercise. So if they want to half code the 5000th
> music player for the Linux desktop and abandon it two years later, go for it.

> If you want to extend the logic of the argument laid out, we should all choose
>Gnome and everything else should be left to rot. That way we have one set of
>apps. To give up our 5000 music players is mostly giving up what we believe in.
>It'd be great if people could get along and all contribute to one amazing
>thing, but people just don't seem to work that way.\

### Final Notes

Linux Mint is a novel,
and [full](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/4ivfan/flavorless_mint_lup_144/) flavoured
distribution which sits at the heart of the Linux Community. Regardless of
whether you personally use it, or your opinions of the new X-Applications, mint
is not going anywhere any time soon. I look forward to seeing more great
developments by the Mint team in the future.
