<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Western Australia in the Human Factors Laboratory. 
	My research project investigates the cognitive mechanisms that underlie performance in safety-critical complex jobs, such as air traffic control,
	 with a particular focus on interruption, workload, and prospective memory.
	  I have a strong interest in reproducible research methods and statistics, 
	  and recently I have been applying Bayesian methods and reproducible research practices to my own work.
	  Currently, I am trying to focus my free time on GNU/Linux, "big data", and machine-learning.
	  Feel free to get in contact with me or read more about my services.
